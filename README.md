This is the repository that contains all the source code for the YouTube tutorial playlist which can be found here: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLPaoO-vpZnumdcb4tZc4x5Q-v7CkrQ6M-

Keep in mind that some OpenGL tutorials are linked to the Resources directory, so they don't stand by themselves (this is done in order to not duplicate large resources such as textures and models across different tutorial directories).

An ImGui tutorial can also be found here.

Exercises for the first couple of tutorial can be found in the Exercises directory. I highly recommend to go through them to get a feeling for OpenGL.

If you find any bugs or things that can be adjusted open an issue, or just write a comment on one of my videos letting me know about the problem. I read all the comments ;)
